# Beautiful Jekyll 

Usa el _Jekyll Theme_  [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll)

## Add content

To add pages to your site, you can either write a markdown file (`.md`) or you can write an HTML file directly.  It is much easier to write markdown than HTML, so I suggest you do that (use the [tutorial I mentioned above](http://markdowntutorial.com/) if you need to learn markdown). You can look at some files on this site to get an idea of how to write markdown. To look at existing files, click on any file that ends in `.md`, for example [`aboutme.md`](./aboutme.md). On the next page you can see some nicely formatted text (there is a word in bold, a link, bullet points), and if you click on the pencil icon to edit the file, you will see the markdown that generated the pretty text. Very easy!

In contrast, look at [`index.html`](./index.html). That's how your write HTML - not as pretty. So stick with markdown if you don't know HTML.

Any file that you add inside the [`_posts`](./_posts) directory will be treated as a blog entry.  You can look at the existing files there to get an idea of how to write blog posts.  After you successfully add your own post, you can delete the existing files inside [`_posts`](./_posts) to remove the sample posts, as those are just demo posts to help you learn.

As mentioned previously, you can use [prose.io](http://prose.io/) to add or edit files instead of doing it directly on GitHub, it can be a little easier that way.

## Last important thing: YAML front matter ("parameters" for a page)

In order to have your new pages use this template and not just be plain pages, you need to add [YAML front matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) to the top of each page. This is where you'll give each page some parameters that I made available, such as a title and subtitle. I'll go into more detail about what parameters are available later. If you don't want to use any parameters on your new page (this also means having no title), then use the empty YAML front matter:

```
---
---
```

If you want to use any parameters, write them between the two lines. For example, you can have this at the top of a page:

```
---
title: Contact me
subtitle: Here you'll find all the ways to get in touch with me
---
```

You can look at the top of [`aboutme.md`](./aboutme.md) or [`index.html`](./index.html) as more examples.

**Important takeaway: ALWAYS add the YAML front matter, which is two lines with three dashes, to EVERY page. If you have any parameters, they go between the two lines.**    
If you don't include YAML then your file will not use the template.
